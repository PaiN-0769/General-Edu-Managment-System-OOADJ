# General-Edu-Managment-System-OOADJ
General Educational Database Management System aims to provide a flexible data management tool that overcomes the shortcomings of commercially available DBMS used in education. It is built on a schema-less database management system, thus granting each user the ability to make the model for their database interactively using the Web app. 
The web app also allows the user to edit their datasets directly, and also has features to map columns in csv/xlsx files to their dataset entities.
This software will allow users to interactively build databases for their specific purpose. 
It also provides some template data models for common entities like student, employee, institution, course, assessment, etc. Each database will be specifically designed for the user thus ensuring that there are no redundant entities/attributes in the database. 
The accompanying Web App will be easy to use and will allow data modeling to be done using simple dropdowns, buttons and input fields, and the backend scripts will do the job of creating the MongoDB database.
